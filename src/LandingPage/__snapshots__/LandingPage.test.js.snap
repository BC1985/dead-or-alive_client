        Sex, drugs and Rock'n'roll. Either one of these or a combination of the three all too often marks the untimely demise of a great musician. Some of the greats are long gone, and some are recently departed. With the high mortality rate that comes with the territory, it can be hard to keep track. Dead or Alive is here to tell you which of the actors in this theatrical tragedy that is the music business is still with us and which are jamming it up in the great gig in the sky. Simply enter the name of a musician below to see if they are alive or dead.
